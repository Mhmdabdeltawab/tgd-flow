# User Management Interface Bug Report

## 1. Edit Button Functionality

### Button Locations and Expected Behavior
- **Quick Edit Button**: Located in the user management table row actions. Expected to open inline permission editing interface directly in the table.
- **Edit Button**: Located in the user management table row actions. Expected to navigate to a dedicated edit page (`/user-management/{userId}`).

### Current Behavior Issues
- No visual loading indicators when either button is clicked
- No feedback to user during the saving process
- The buttons remain clickable during data processing operations

### Console Errors
- No visible console errors when buttons are clicked
- Network requests are being initiated but no visual feedback is provided

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Issue persists across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Behavior is consistent across all tested environments

### Data Operations
- Quick Edit: Successfully fetches permissions data but doesn't show loading state
- Save Changes: Sends data to database but no loading indicator during the process
- Edit (navigation): Successfully navigates but doesn't indicate loading state

## 2. Add New User Flow

### Steps to Reproduce
a. Navigate to user management interface
b. Click "Add New User" button in the header
c. Enter email: test@tagaddod.com
d. Select role type: User
e. Submit form

### Current Behavior
- Modal appears correctly
- Form accepts input
- On submission, error occurs: "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'user_permissions'"
- User is not created
- No permissions are assigned

### Expected Behavior
- User should be created with email and role
- Default permissions should be automatically assigned based on role type
- User should appear in the table after creation

## 3. Error Details

### Full Error Message
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table 'user_permissions'
```

### Database Tables Affected
- `users` - Unable to create new user record
- `user_permissions` - RLS policy violation when attempting to insert permissions

### Current Permissions Configuration
- RLS is enabled on the `user_permissions` table
- Current policy appears to be restricting insert operations
- Admin users should have permission to create new users and their permissions

### User Role Attempting Action
- Admin user (as indicated by the presence of user management access)

## 4. Environment Information

### Browser Information
- Chrome Version: 120.0.6099.216
- Firefox Version: 123.0
- Safari Version: 17.0

### Application Version
- Frontend Version: 1.0.0
- Backend/API Version: 1.0.0

### User Role/Permissions Level
- Admin user with full user management permissions

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Edit Button Loading State**: The `savingUserId` state is correctly implemented but the loading indicators are not properly displayed during the saving process.

2. **RLS Policy Violation**: The Row Level Security policy on the `user_permissions` table is preventing the insertion of new permissions records when creating a new user. This suggests that:
   - The current user's token may not have the correct claims
   - The RLS policy may be too restrictive
   - The service role key may not be used for these operations

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Edit Button Loading State**:
   - Ensure loading indicators are properly displayed when buttons are clicked
   - Disable buttons during loading states to prevent multiple submissions

2. **RLS Policy Violation**:
   - Review and update the RLS policies on the `user_permissions` table
   - Ensure admin users have proper permissions to insert records
   - Consider using the service role key for user management operations
   - Verify that the current user's JWT token contains the necessary claims

3. **User Creation Flow**:
   - Implement a transaction that creates both the user and their permissions
   - Add better error handling to provide more specific error messages
   - Add logging to track the exact point of failure

## Additional Notes

- The error suggests that the application is correctly enforcing security policies, but the policies may be too restrictive for legitimate administrative operations
- The UI feedback issues are separate from the database permission issues but both need to be addressed for a complete solution
